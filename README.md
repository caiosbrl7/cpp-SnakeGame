The famous snake game that I made for fun and to start learning some basics on game development.
I pretend to do another version of this with some graphics library but for now I think it's really good for a first-timer.

I used Visual Studio IDE in this one and I used both the standard C++ library for i/o and the conio.h library that reads information coming from the keyboard.

Definitly learned a lot and had some fun!
